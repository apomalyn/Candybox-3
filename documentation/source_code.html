    </p>
    <h2>Where do I get the source code?</h2>
    <p>
      Candy Box 2 is written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript">TypeScript</a>, a language which compiles to javascript using tsc, the TypeScript compiler.
      This language is published under the Apache License, which is GPL compatible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, there are three ways to get the source code :
      <br/>
      <ul>
        <li>The <a href="../candybox3.min.js">compressed, javascript version</a> used when you play the game. Caution : since it is compressed, it is hardly readable.</li>
        <li>The <a href="../candybox3.js">uncompressed javascript version</a> (this is the file generated by the TypeScript compiler).</li>
        <li>The TypeScript files. This is the best solution if you want to work on the code. See below to know how to download them.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>How do I work on the code?</h2>
    <p>
      The first thing to do is to download the <a href="https://github.com/apomalyn/Candybox-3/releases">.zip file</a> containing everything you need : the game itself, the TypeScript files, the ascii art, the compilation scripts, and even this page!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, there are three steps :<br/>
      <ul>
        <li>Install all the external software you will need to compile the game. Install <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>, the <a href="install_tsc.html">typescript compiler</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-js">uglify-js</a> and <a href="http://python.org/download/releases/3.0/">Python 3</a>. </li>
        <br/>
        <li>Try to run the compilation script included in the .zip file you downloaded earlier. Use compile.sh to compile project. If you are on windows use the Git Bash to execute this script. If you encounter any problem, the fastest way to get an answer is to ask on <a href="https://twitter.com/_adaendra">Twitter by private message</a>.</li>
        <br/>
        <li>If no error show up during the compilation process, it means it worked! You can now begin to work on the code by modyfing the TypeScript files in the code/main directory. You can play with the code, make your own ASCII art game, or maybe <a href="create_quest.html">create a quest for Candy Box 3</a>?</li>
      </ul>
