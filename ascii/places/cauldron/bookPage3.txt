             Turtle potion
             ¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨
  The turtle potion is a bit harder to
brew than the health potion. You will
need both %CANDIES% and %LOLLIPOPS%.

  If you drink this potion in a quest,
it will turn you into a turtle. You
will move slower, but you will also be
more resistant to you enemies attacks.

  Instructions :
   - Put 50 %CANDIES% in your cauldron
   - Add 500 %LOLLIPOPS% in your cauldron
   - Mix during more or less 10 seconds
   - Stop mixing
   - Add 50 %CANDIES%
   - Mix again for a few seconds
   - Put into bottles

  And now the most important thing you
should never forget : once you will be
a turtle, do NOT turn over. You
wouldn't be able to get up.
