              Health potion
              ¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨

  The health potion is one of the
easiest to brew, really. It only
requires %CANDIES%. Used in quests, it
will heal you by giving you back 100
health points.

  Instructions :
   - Put 100 %CANDIES% in your cauldron
   - Mix for a few seconds
   - Put into bottles

  Just like for any potion, you can of
course multiply the quantities. For
example, if you use 300 %CANDIES%
instead of 100, you will get
3 health potions.
